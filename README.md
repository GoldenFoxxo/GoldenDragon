# GoldenDragon
GoldenDragon Bot. It is in development or beta stage, there may be bugs found.

For music stuff to work (currently GoldenDragon_Dev) use youtube-dl, opus.dll, sodium.dll, and ffmpeg
if you have old youtube-dl.conf, some function may not work, you can use settings that I currently use.
